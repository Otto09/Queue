# Queue
Application in which a queue structure is considered represented using a series of integer values. In addition to this series of values, an integer variable (queue pointer) is also declared. This will permanently have the value of the index of the last element in the queue. To operate the queue, the well-known enque () and dequeue () functions created in the application are used. The enque () function adds values to the queue at the end of the series, and dequeue () extracts the first element from the queue, shifts all values in the string to a left position, and decrements the variable (queue pointer). After this shift, the first element reaches the element that was in the second position. Add a value to the queue. Then the first element is extracted from the queue series, after which another element (the first) is extracted, but it is not preserved.
